# Comparisons of IntServ and DiffServ
1. Resource allocation to **aggregated traffic (class)** rather than _individual flows_
   - In DiffServ, **performance assurance to individual flows in a forwarding class is provided through prioritization and provisioning** rather than per-flow reservation
   - In IntServ, resources allocated to _individual flows_ 
2. **Traffic policing on the edge(Router)** and _class-based forwarding in the core(forwarding)_*
   - In DiffServ, only boundary nodes at the edge of the network classify traffic and mark packets; the interior nodes use the forwarding classes encoded in the packet header to determine the treatment accordingly
   - In IntServ, all nodes perform packet classification and scheduling
3. Define **forwarding behaviors**, not services
   - DiffServ defines forwarding treatments (i.e., forwarding classes), **not end-to-end services**
   - _IntServ defines services. The treatment of packets is not part of the standard_
4. **Guarantee by <font color=red>provisioning</font>** rather than _reservation_
   - In DiffServ, resource assurance is through provisioning and prioritization (achieve different levels of services)
   - In IntServ, it‚Äôs through per-flow resource reservation (achieve absolute guarantee)
5. Emphasis on **service level agreements** rather than _dynamic 
signaling_
   - Purpose of DiffServ is to ensure the long-term SLA between customers and service providers
   - IntServ provides dynamic resource reservation, instead
6. Focus on a **single domain** vs. _end to end_
   - The deployment of DiffServ in the Internet can be incremental
   - The IntServ model is inherently end-to-end

# Conceptual Operations
When traffic entering a network,
1. **classified first**;
2. **possibly conditioned**;
3. **assigned a DSCP** (class or class id number);
4. **forwarded**

#  Basic Approach of DiffServ Framework
1. With Differentiated services (DS) traffic is divided into a small number of groups called forwarding classes
2. The forwarding class is encoded in the IP packet header
3. **Each forwarding class represent a predefined forwarding treatment in terms of drop priority and bandwidth allocation**
4. Boundary node (edge node) and interior node (core node) are with 
different responsibilities
   - **Boundary router** (egress or ingress router) performs **packet classification and traffic conditioning** (token bucket„ÄÅdrop„ÄÅlabel)
   - **Interior router** (core router) performs **class-based packet forwarding**

#  Per-Hop Behaviors (PHBs)
1. PHB is a description of the **externally observable forwarding behavior at a DS node**
2. Each PHB is represented by a 6-bit value, called a **Differentiated Services codepoint (DSCP)**
3. All packets with the **same codepoint are referred to as a <font color=red>behavior aggregate (BA)</font>**, and they **receive the same forwarding treatment**
4. Examples of PHBs
<font color=red>
   - Guarantee a minimal bandwidth allocation of x% of a link to a BA (absolute term)
   - Guarantee a minimal bandwidth allocation of x% of a link to a BA, with proportional fair sharing of any excess link capacity (relative term)

#  Services
1. Services are visible to customers, whereas PHBs are hidden inside the network elements
2. In DiffServ, **services are defined in the form of a service level agreement (SLA) between a customer and its service provider -> <font color=red>customer</font>**
3. One of the important elements in an SLA is the **traffic conditioning agreement (TCA) -> <font color=red>Packet</font>**
4. **TCA details the <font color=red>service parameters</font> for traffic profile and policing actions**
   - **Traffic profiles**, such as token bucket parameters for each of the classes
   - **Performance metrics**, such as throughput, delay, and drop priorities
   - Actions for **non-conformant packets**
   - Additional **marking** and **shaping services** provided by the service provider
5. In additional to TCA, **SLA** may also contain other service characteristics and business-related agreements such as a**vailability, security, monitoring, accounting, pricing and billing**
6. SLA may be static or dynamic (**Preplanning** is necessary, and changes on the fly are not allowed.)
7. Services can be defined in either **quantitative or qualitative terms**
   - **Quantitative**: specify the parameters in **<font color=red>absolute</font>** terms, e.g., 5-sec max delay
   - **Qualitative**: use **<font color=red>relative</font>** terms, e.g., lower delay

#  Differentiated Services Field
1. DiffServ uses **6 bits in the IP packet header** to encode the forwarding treatment
2. Current IP packet header **includes an 8-bit field called the IP TOS field**: **<font color=red>3-bit precedence (represents the priorities for the traffic), a 3-bit type of service (TOS)</font>**, and 2 unused bits

![](../src/Differentiated%20Services%20Field.png)
> D : Low Delay
> T : High Througtput
> H : High Reliability
> 
> Best Effort : 00000000

3. DiffServ redefines the existing TOS field to indicate the forwarding treatment
   - The first 6 bits of the DS field are used as a DSCP to encode the PHB for a packet at each DS node
   - The remaining 2 bits are reserved for future use
   - The DSCP should be treated as an index, and the mapping of DSCPs to PHBs must be configurable
   - The codepoint space is divided into 3 pools
     - A pool of **32 recommended codepoints to be standardized**
     - A pool of 16 codepoints to be reserved for experimental or local use
     - A pool of 16 codepoints to be available for experimental and local use but may be subject to standardization if pool 1 is ever exhausted
4. Default PHB codepoint
   - **Backward compatible with the current best effort forwarding treatment**
   -  Packets belonging to the default forwarding class may be sent into a network without any policing and the network will try to deliver as many of these packets as possible and as soon as possible
   - Other forwarding classes have higher priorities to network resources than the default forwarding class
   - **Some minimal bandwidth is reserved for the default forwarding class to avoid starvation**
   - The assigned codepint is 000000
5. **Class selector codepoints**
   - Maintain partially backward compatible with known current use of the IP precedence field
   - **We name this set of PHBs class selector PHBs**
   - **Assigned codepoints: xxx000**
   - The **<font color=red>eight class selector (2^3)</font> PHBs** **must yield at least <font color=red>two different forwarding classes</font>**
   - **The PHB mapped by a codepoint with the larger numerical value must receive better or equal forwarding treatment** than the one with a lower numerical value
6. Current codepoint allocation (been standardized by IETF)
   - **Assured forwarding (AF)** (RFC 2597 and RFC 3260): assurance of delivery under conditions
   - **Expedited forwarding (EF)** (RFC 3246): dedicated to low-loss, low-latency traffic  (**Even more stringent**)

#  Traffic Classification and Conditioning
1. Two responsibilities of boundary routers are **classification and conditioning**
2. Classification module contains a classifier and a marker
3. Classifier divides incoming packets streams into multiple groups based on some predefined rules

![](../src/Traffic%20Classification%20and%20Conditioning.png)

4. There are two basic types of classifiers: **behavior aggregate (BA) or multifield (MF)**
5. **<font color=red>BA</font>** is the simplest DS classifier and it selects packets **based solely on the DSCP values**
6. **<font color=red>MF</font>** uses a combination of one or more fields of the five-tuple(**source address, destination address, source port, destination port, and protocol ID**) in IP header for classification
7. Traffic conditioner is to enforce the TCA between customer and service provider
8. Traffic conditioner consists of 4 basic elements: **meter, marker, shaper, and dropper**
9. **Meter**
   - A meter measures the traffic flow from a customer against its traffic profile
   - **In-profile packets are allowed to enter the network**, while **out-of-profile packets are conditioned based on the TCS**
   - Most **meters are implemented as <font color=red>token buckets</font>**
10. **Marker**
    - Markers **<font color=red>set the DS field</font> of a packet to a particular DSCP**, and add the marked packets to the forwarding class
    - Markers may act on unmarked packets or remark marked packets
    - Marking could be done by the applications itself, the first-hop router of the LAN, or the boundary router of a service provider
    - **Remarking is necessary at the boundary of two administrative domains using different DSCPs**
    - When a packet remarked with **DSCP receives worse forwarding treatment ‚Üí <font color=red>PHB demotion (typically)</font>**
    - When **receiving better forwarding treatment ‚Üí PHB promotion**
    - Typically boundary routers demote out-of-profile packets to a DSCP with worse forwarding treatmen
11. **Shaper**
    - **Shaper delays the non-conformant packets** in order to bring the stream into compliance with the agree-on traffic profile
    - **<font color=red>A marker marks non-conformant packets and lets them into the network, whereas a shaper prevents these packets from entering the network till the stream conforms to the traffic profile</font>**
    - A much stronger form of policing than marking
12. **Dropper**
    - Dropping is another action may be applied to out-of-profile packets
    - For a shaper, it buffers packets temporarily, while for a dropper, it just drops out-of-profile packets
    - Dropping is much easier to implement
13. Location of traffic classifier and conditioner
    - Usually situated with **DS ingress and egress nodes** where traffic goes across domains
    - Within a source domain
      - Traffic source and intermediate nodes within the source domain may perform classification and marking before packets leave the domain by the host or the 1st hop router. This is referred to as premarking
      - Premarking allows the source domain to classify packets based on local policies (e.g., CEO‚Äôs PC, or mission-critical servers)
    - At the boundary of a DS domain
      - The ingress node of the downstream domain performs all necessary classification and conditioning
      - If two domains use different codepoints for a PHB, any premarked packets must be remarked at the boundary, either the egress node of the upstream domain or the ingress node of the downstream domain may perform the mapping
    - In interior DS nodes
      - At some heavily congested hot spots, additional traffic policing may be applied or the traffic may be shaped at some points to ensure arrival pattern

#  Assured Forwarding 
1. Basic idea behind AF came from the **RED(Randy Early Drop) with In and Out (RIO) scheme**
2. What‚Äôs RIO?
   - **A service profile specifies the expected capacity for the user**
   - Boundary nodes monitor the traffic flows and **tag the packets(Not DSCP,but Priority)** as being in or out of their profiles
   - During congestion the packets tagged as out will be dropped first
   - The service provider should provide their networks to meet the expected capacities for all in-profile packets and allow out-of-profile packets only when excessive bandwidth is available

![](../src/RIO%20Scheme.png)

3. AF standard extended the basic in or out marking in RIO into a structure of **<font color=red>four</font> forwarding classes**, and within each forwarding class, **<font color=red>three</font> drop precedences**  **(3*4 = 12)**
4. Each forwarding class is allocated a minimum amount of buffers and bandwidth
5. When backlogged packets from an AF forwarding class exceed a specified threshold, **packets with the highest priority are dropped first and then packets with the lower drop priority**
6. Note that **comparing two drop priorities in <font color=red>two</font> AF classes may not be meaningful**
7. An example of AF implementation
   - Assume link capacity be 100 Mbps
   - Minimum bandwidth requirements of 4 forwarding classes are 2, 4, 8, and 16 Mbps
   - Proportional sharing the excessive bandwidth
   - Weight: (1:2:4:8)
   - Excessive bandwidth shares are 4 Mbps, 8 Mbps, 16 Mbps, and 32 Mbps

![](../src/AF%20PHB%20code%20points.png)

#  Expedited Forwarding
1. EF is to create low loss, low delay, and assured bandwidth services
2. EF is defined as a forwarding treatment for a traffic aggregate that the departure rate of the aggregate‚Äôs packet from any DS node must equal or exceed a configurable rate
3. **EF traffic should receive this rate independent of the intensity of any other traffic attempting to transit the node**
4. EF traffic can preempt other traffic within a certain limit
5. **Assigned codepoint is 101110**

# End-to-End Resource Management
1. **<font color=red>Integrated services over differentiated services</font>**
   - Two-tier resource allocation mode: DiffServ distributes aggregated resources in the core networks to customer networks; IntServ further allocates the resources at finer granularity to individual users or flows
   - At the boundary of the network the IntServ requests are mapped onto the underlying DiffServ network, included mappings are
     - Selecting an appropriate PHB or a set of PHBs for the requested services
     - Performing appropriate policing at the edge of the DiffServ network
     - Exporting IntServ parameters from the DiffServ network
   - An illustrative example of IntServ over DiffServ
     - An enterprise network with 4 routers and 2 LANs
     - The access router connects the enterprise network to its ISP and is responsible for traffic classification
     - When a sender initiates a transaction, it exchanges RSVP PATH and RESV messages with the receiver
     - The RSVP messages are ignored through the ISP that supports only DiffServ
     - When RESV messages pass through the access router, it consults with the policy server to decide about admission control
     - Suppose the enterprise has paid for 10 Mbps service and 9 Mbps has been allocated, less than 1 Mbps new reservation will be admitted
   - Policy server can decide how IntServ requests should be mapped to DiffServ model


   ![](../src/End-to-End%20Resource%20Management.png)

2. Interdomain bandwidth allocation
   - Different domains are usually separately owned and administrated, and the relationship between any two different domains is governed by the SLA
   - The SLA could be dynamically and infrequently changed, and **<font color=red>bandwidth broker (BB)</font> approach can achieve dynamic interdomain resource negotiation**
   - An illustrative example
     - The backbone consists of 3 ISPs and an enterprise network that can communicate with many receivers in any of the ISPs
     - The BB of the enterprise network performs admission control for reservation requests from its own users

   ![](../src/End-to-End%20Resource%20Management-1.png)
3. In essence, BBs act as resource management agents for their ISPs and perform the following 3 main functions
   - **Admission control**: decisions are based on the predefined provisioning algorithms for the networks
   - **Policy control**: handle the administrative (e.g., priority and special restrictions) and pricing policies
   -** Reservation aggregation**: collect multiple requests from users and make a single request for resources to improve the system scalability
   - The drawback of BB approach is that BBs must know where the new traffic is going in order to make accurate bandwidth requests
